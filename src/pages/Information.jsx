AquaYield utilizes this data to assess the moisture content in the soil at any given time, allowing for accurate irrigation scheduling. By incorporating SMAP data, farmers get real-time insights into soil conditions, helping them make informed decisions about when and how much to irrigate, reducing water wastage and improving crop health.",
